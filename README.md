# 📈 NVDA Quant Dashboard: AI-Powered Stock Prediction

A full-stack quantitative analysis and real-time prediction tool for NVIDIA ($NVDA) stock. It combines neural networks for time-series forecasting with Natural Language Processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis, delivering insights through a reactive, custom Cyberpunk UI.

## 🎯 Project Objective
The main goal is to build an end-to-end AI pipeline that doesn't solely rely on historical prices (technical analysis) but actively integrates the news factor (fundamental/sentiment analysis). The system provides an automated, short-term estimation of the stock's price direction (UP/DOWN) for the next active market hour.

## ⚙️ Data Pipeline
The FastAPI backend acts as the data orchestrator:
1. **Market Data (Prices):** Fetched in real-time via the `yfinance` library, pulling hourly candlesticks (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).
2. **Sentiment Data (News):** Calls News APIs to fetch the latest headlines regarding NVIDIA and the broader AI/Semiconductor sector.
3. **Data Merging:** The two data streams are merged using strict chronological sorting. Missing sentiment values (NaN) are forward-filled to ensure every stock timestamp has a corresponding sentiment score.

## 🧠 AI Architecture & Inference
The core prediction engine is powered by a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network, implemented in **PyTorch**. 
* **Feature Engineering:** The model processes 2 primary features: the Close Price and a Sentiment Score. The sentiment score is generated by passing news headlines through **FinBERT** (an NLP model specifically fine-tuned on financial text).
* **Scaling:** Before inference, raw data undergoes MinMax Scaling using parameters saved during the training phase (`scaler_params.npy`).
* **LSTM Mechanism:** The network ingests a rolling "window" (Sequence Length) of the **last 10 hours** (`SEQ_LENGTH=10`). It analyzes the sequential pattern of these 10 data points and outputs a scaled prediction, which is then inversely transformed back to a real USD value.

## ⏱️ Prediction Horizon & Market Logic
* **Prediction Horizon:** The model strictly forecasts **1 hour ahead** (Next-Hour Forecast). It focuses on micro-trends rather than long-term investing.
* **Market State Awareness:** The backend is fully aware of **NASDAQ** trading hours. If the market is closed (Weekends, After-Hours, Pre-Market), the system accurately calculates and displays the **next valid market open hour** (e.g., Monday 09:30 AM EST) instead of blindly predicting the next chronological hour.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **AI / Machine Learning:** PyTorch, LSTM, FinBERT (HuggingFace)
* **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, Pandas, yfinance, Uvicorn
* **Frontend:** Vue.js 3, Vite, Chart.js, TailwindCSS
* **Architecture:** RESTful API, Reactive UI, State Management

## 🚀 Local Setup

**1. Start the Backend (Terminal 1)**
```bash
cd nvda_predictor
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Create a `.env` file in the `nvda_predictor` directory and add your `NEWS_API_KEY`:
  ```
  NEWS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  ```
- Then start the backend server:
  ```bash
  uvicorn main:app --reload
  ```
